The code is developed using `Simplicity Studio v4` on `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`. The code also needs **dbprint** functionality, which needs to be added alongside the code on this repository for it to compile again. See [dbprint GIT repo](https://github.com/Fescron/dbprint) for more info regarding this.

## Code flow

![Flowchart](/documentation/figures/flowchart-full.png?raw=true "Flowchart")

**Extra notes on the flowchart:**

- **(\*1):** The following things get initialized:
    - Chip
    - GPIO wakeup (buttons & ADXL INT1)
    - ADC
    - Disable RN2483
    - Accelerometer (initialize SPI and use it to configure the accelerometer
- **(\*2):** On every external temperature measurement the VDD and DATA pin get re-configured. The oneWire protocol is achieved using *bit-banging*.
- **(\*3):** The RN2483 module gets enabled and configured before sending the data. Afterwards it gets disabled again. The **status** message is always send, measurements only if there are any recorded.
- **(\*4):** Only one set of measurements are send along with the status message.
- **(\*5):** The value of **X** depends on a configurd setting.
- **(\*6):** A status message is send along with any recorded measurements.

<br/>

- Before entering a *sleep* state **all GPIO (data) pins are disabled** so they can't consume any power.
- **Clocks and peripherals** are only enabled when necessary.
- If an **error** occures this gets **forwarded to the cloud using a LoRaWAN status message**.
- To conserve sended bytes a **custom data-format** was used (along with a *decoder*).
- Negative internal and external temperatures were successfully send and displayed. The internal temperature seems to be 2 - 3 Â°C off.
