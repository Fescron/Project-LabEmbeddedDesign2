 *    @li `0` - Keep the MCU in a `while(true)` loop if the `error` method is called while flashing the LED and displaying a UART message.
 *    @li `1` - Display a UART message when the `error` method is called but also forward the number to the cloud using LoRaWAN. Don't go in a `while(true)` loop.  */
